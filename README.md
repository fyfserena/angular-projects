#### some installation

1. make sure you install node.js by
   `node --version`

2. stall npm
   `npm install -g @angular/cli`  (-g means globally)

3. create a new project
   `ng new hellow-world`  (can only be alphabet and - (dash))

   It will use npm to download 3 party libraries

4. go into hellow-world folder and check it runs 
   `ng serve`

5. open http://localhost:4200/ and can see it is running!

* e2e: end to end test, automatic test mocking a user

* node_modules: store libraries, put into a bundle during deployment later

* srs: our source code (assets, environment, package.json...)

* pls use *let* key work than *var* when defining a variable in a scope ** 

* a note:** when there is a compile error in ts, tsc still can generate a valid js file which compile let to var (old version js)

#### Types in typescript
see in ts-hello file
